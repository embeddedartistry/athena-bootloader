   WriteNetworkSettings

   This sketch writes a set of network configuration settings to EEPROM
   in such a way that both the `arduino-tftpboot` bootloader & a sketch
   can read them back later and share the same settings.

   As commented below these are the settings available for modification:

     * Gateway IP address
     * Subnet mask
     * MAC address
     * Arduino device IP address

   Once the settings have been written to EEPROM, an LED on pin 9
   (if connected) will flash rapdily.


   The default settings used by the bootloader:

      192,168,1,254,                       // Gateway IP address
      255,255,255,0,                       // Subnet mask
      0x12,0x34,0x45,0x78,0x9A,0xBC,       // MAC address
      192,168,1,1,                         // Arduino device IP address


   Settings suitable for link-local use:

      169,254,1,1,                         // Gateway IP address
      255,255,0,0,                         // Subnet mask
      0x12,0x34,0x45,0x78,0x9A,0xBC,       // MAC address
      169,254,254,169,                     // Arduino device IP address
